## 0.7.0

- Hermeto release - <https://github.com/hermetoproject/hermeto/releases/tag/0.60.0>
- The `.repo` file for RPM dependencies is now named `hermeto.repo` instead of `cachi2.repo`

## 0.6.0

- Hermeto release - <https://github.com/hermetoproject/hermeto/releases/tag/0.59.0>

## 0.5.0

- Hermeto release - <https://github.com/hermetoproject/hermeto/releases/tag/0.58.0>

## 0.4.1

### Fixed

- Mount the `trusted-ca` volume in the `use-trusted-artifact` and `create-trusted-artifact` steps.
  Previously, the mount was missing, which means the task did not support container registries
  with certificates signed by a private/self-signed CA.

## 0.4.0

- Hermeto releases from 0.55.0 to 0.57.1 - <https://github.com/hermetoproject/hermeto/compare/0.55.0...0.57.1>

## 0.3.2

- Added `enable-package-registry-proxy` parameter to enable use of the package registry proxy when prefetching dependencies.
- Added `SERVICE_CA_TRUST_CONFIG_MAP_NAME` and `SERVICE_CA_TRUST_CONFIG_MAP_KEY` parameters to mount the OpenShift service CA for verifying TLS connections to in-cluster services such as the package registry proxy.

## 0.3.1

### Added

- In addition to the `cachi2.env` file, the output directory will also have
  a `prefetch.env` file.
  - Both files have the same content, `prefetch.env` is the primary one.
    `cachi2.env` stays for now, for backwards compatibility with existing Tasks.
- In addition to the `*.env` files, the output directory will also have
  a `prefetch-env.json` file.
  - This will enable future versions of the buildah Task to inject prefetch environment
    variables without any invasive editing of the containerfile.

## 0.3

- Removed deprecated `dev-package-managers` parameter.
- Switched from bash implementation to Konflux Build CLI.
